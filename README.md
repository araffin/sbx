# Stable Baselines Jax (SB3 + Jax = SBX)

Proof of concept version of [Stable-Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) in Jax.

Implemented algorithms:
- [Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01290) and [SAC-N](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01548)
- [Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04269)
- [Dropout Q-Functions for Doubly Efficient Reinforcement Learning (DroQ)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=xCVJMsPv3RT)
- [Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347)
- [Deep Q Network (DQN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602)
- [Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09477)
- [Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971)


### Install using pip

For the latest master version:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/araffin/sbx
```
or:
```
pip install sbx-rl
```

## Example


```python
import gymnasium as gym

from sbx import TQC, DroQ, SAC, PPO, DQN, TD3, DDPG

env = gym.make("Pendulum-v1")

model = TQC("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1)
model.learn(total_timesteps=10_000, progress_bar=True)

vec_env = model.get_env()
obs = vec_env.reset()
for i in range(1000):
    action, _states = model.predict(obs, deterministic=True)
    obs, reward, done, info = vec_env.step(action)
    vec_env.render()

vec_env.close()
```
